# drag-and-drop-angular9
A simple yet effective "Drag & Drop" file upload front-end implementation using Angular 9. Dropping files on different areas (read: components) will automatically pop a progress bar modal at the bottom of the screen showing the upload information. The progress bar will automatically close after 2-3 seconds of upload completion.
